    "Least Squares Positioning is a well-known algorithm for estimating the robot localization $x$ given a set of known landmarks in a map. Least Squares is akin to find the best pose $\\hat{x}$ by solving a system of equations of the form:\n",

    "- $m$ represents the number of observations, and \n",

An approach to address this could be to drop some of the additional equations, but given that observations $z$ are inaccurate (they have been affected by some noise), we may use the additional information to try to mitigate such noise. However, by doing that $H$ is no a squared matrix anymore, hence not being invertible. \n",
