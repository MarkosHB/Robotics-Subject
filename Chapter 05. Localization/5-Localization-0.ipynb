    "Concretely, the goal of **robot localization** is, given a map of the environment and a sequence of sensor measurements, to retrieve the robot's pose in such environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Localization problems can be grouped into different types (see Fig.1 below):\n",
    "- **Position tracking**: the robot knows approximately where it is (for example, using odometry readings, which have to come at a certain frequency).\n",
    "- **Global localization**: the robot has no clue where it is (*e.g.* GPS). It is needed when the robot is turned on.\n",
    "- **Kidnapped robot problem**: the robot thinks that it knows where it is, but is wrong!\n",
